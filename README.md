**Magisk Installtion on Samsung j7**

**`Here's a step-by-step guide on how to install Magisk on a Samsung J7 device:`**

**1.	`Backup your data`**: Before proceeding with any modifications, it's recommended to back up your important data and files to prevent any potential data loss.
   
**2.	`Enable USB Debugging`**: On your Samsung J7, go to "Settings" > "`Developer options`" (If Developer options are not visible, go to "Settings" > "About phone" and tap on the "Build number" multiple times until you see a message indicating that you've become a developer). Once in "Developer options," `enable "USB debugging`."
  
**3.	`Unlock the bootloader`:** Unlocking the bootloader is an important step, as it allows you to modify the system partitions. Keep in mind that unlocking the bootloader may vary depending on the device model and software version. You can search for specific instructions for your Samsung J7 model and firmware version.

**4.	`Download required files`: Download the following files to your computer:**

   - Odin: This is a tool used for flashing firmware and custom recovery on Samsung devices. You can find Odin on various Android forums or websites.

   - TWRP custom recovery: Download the appropriate TWRP recovery image for your specific Samsung J7 model. You can find the TWRP image on the official TWRP website or the XDA Developers forum.

   - Magisk: Download the latest Magisk zip file from the official Magisk website or the XDA Developers forum.


**5.	`Install TWRP custom recovery`:**

   - Extract the Odin tool from the downloaded file (if it's in a compressed format).
   
   - Run Odin as an administrator on your computer.
   
   - Power off your Samsung J7 and boot it into Download Mode by pressing and holding the Power + Home + Volume Down buttons simultaneously. Once the device is in Download Mode, connect it to your computer using a USB cable.
   
   - In Odin, you should see a blue or yellow ID:COM box indicating that your device is connected.
   
   - Click on the "AP" button in Odin and select the TWRP recovery image file you downloaded.
   
   - Uncheck the "Auto Reboot" option in Odin.
   
   - Double-check that everything is set correctly, and then click on the "Start" button in Odin to flash TWRP recovery on your Samsung J7.
   
   - Once the flashing process is complete, you'll see a "PASS!" message in Odin.

**6.	`Boot into TWRP recovery`:**

   - Power off your Samsung J7.
   
   - Press and hold the Power + Home + Volume Up buttons simultaneously until you see the Samsung logo and the device vibrates. Release the Power button but continue holding the other two buttons.
   
   - After a few seconds, you should boot into TWRP recovery mode.

**7.	`Install Magisk via TWRP`:**

- In TWRP recovery, select "Install" or "Install ZIP."
  
- Navigate to the location where you saved the Magisk zip file and select it.

- Swipe the slider to flash Magisk on your Samsung J7.

- Once the installation is complete, select the "Reboot System" option.

**8.	`Verify Magisk installation`:**

- After your device restarts, check your app drawer for the Magisk Manager app. If it's present, it means Magisk is successfully installed.

- Open the Magisk Manager app to manage root access and enjoy the benefits of Magisk on your Samsung J7.
  

**`NOTE`**: Remember, rooting your device and installing Magisk carries certain risks, and it can void your warranty. Make sure you understand the implications and proceed at your own discretion.
